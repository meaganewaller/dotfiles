# House Style (`--style`)

Referenced from [SKILL.md](../SKILL.md). Only relevant when the writer passes `--style <config-or-guide>`.

`--style` copyedits to a house style on top of the de-AI pass (which always runs). No bundled guides. This layer is not a guide registry: it applies **register/voice** directives and removes AI tells, on top of whatever **mechanics** you enforce.

**Preferred: a config file.** `--style ./house.json` (or a bare name matching `examples/<name>.json`) applies a user-supplied JSON config and verifies the checkable subset of its mechanics with `node scripts/check-style.js <file> --config <path>` (exit 0 clean / 1 hard violation / 2 tool error). A config is JSON: **`register`** (voice directives you apply as written) plus **`mechanics`** (`quotes` and `latinAbbrev` hard-checkable; `headings`, `emDash`, `spellNumbersUpTo` advisory; `serialComma` model-applied). Schema and rationale: `examples/README.md`. Open the output by naming the resolved config (`Applying config examples/technical.json; checkable mechanics verified.`), the way the fallback below names its guide, so which mode ran is never ambiguous.

**How `--style` composes.** It is a third axis alongside `--voice` and `--context` (see [profiles.md](profiles.md)), and the narrowest wins: `mechanics` beat everything (they're checkable), then `--voice`, then a config's `register`, then `--context`. So `--voice blunt` with a config asking for warmth stays blunt, while that config's `emDash: deliberate` still governs dashes.

**Fallback: a named guide from memory.** If someone passes `--style "APA"` or `"Chicago"` with no config, you may apply it from general knowledge as best-effort, not as a feature. Open with a status line such as `Applying APA from general knowledge (not verified; no compliance claim).`, apply the register and mechanics you know, and make no compliance claim. Do **not** reproduce the guide's copyrighted text, and note that your knowledge may reflect an older edition. Paywalled guides (Chicago, APA, MLA, AP) are never bundled in any form.

**Resolving `--style <arg>`.** A path, or a bare name matching `examples/<name>.json`, loads that config (apply and verify); anything else is the named-guide fallback above. When a guide's mechanics conflict with the AI-ism catalog the guide wins the mechanic (for example, CMOS keeps deliberate em dashes); still flag the AI *habit* such as em-dash stacking. A bare de-AI request (no `--style`) is unchanged; don't apply a guide to a genre it wasn't written for.
