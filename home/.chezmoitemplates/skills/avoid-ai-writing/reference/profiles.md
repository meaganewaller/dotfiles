# Context and Voice Profiles

Referenced from [SKILL.md](../SKILL.md). Context profiles set how strict to be for a given audience; voice profiles set how the prose should sound. They're independent axes — you can write blunt for a blog or warm for docs.

## Context profiles

Pass an optional context hint to adjust rule strictness. If no context is specified, auto-detect from content cues (short + hashtags = social, code blocks = technical, salutation = email, default = blog).

### Profile definitions

**`linkedin`** — Short-form social. Punchy fragments, visual formatting matter.
**`blog`** — Default. Standard long-form prose. All rules apply at full strength.
**`technical-blog`** — Long-form with code, architecture, APIs. Technical terms get a pass.
**`investor-email`** — High-trust audience. Tighten everything; promotional language is the biggest risk.
**`docs`** — Documentation, READMEs, guides. Clarity over voice.
**`casual`** — Slack messages, internal notes, quick replies. Only catch the worst offenders.

### Tolerance matrix

Rules not listed in the table apply at full strength across all profiles. Rule names refer to sections in [patterns.md](patterns.md) and the tables in [word-tables.md](word-tables.md).

| Rule | linkedin | blog | technical-blog | investor-email | docs | casual |
|------|----------|------|----------------|----------------|------|--------|
| Em dashes | relaxed (2/post OK) | strict | strict | strict | relaxed | skip |
| Bold overuse | relaxed (bold hooks OK) | strict | strict | strict | relaxed | skip |
| Emoji in headers | relaxed (1-2 end-of-line OK) | strict | strict | strict | skip | skip |
| Excessive bullets | skip (lists work on LinkedIn) | strict | relaxed (technical lists OK) | strict | skip (lists are docs) | skip |
| Hedging | strict | strict | relaxed ("may" is accurate in technical) | strict | relaxed | skip |
| Word table (full list) | strict | strict | **partial** (see below) | strict | relaxed | P0 only |
| Promotional language | relaxed (some sell is expected) | strict | strict | **extra strict** | strict | skip |
| Significance inflation | strict | strict | strict | **extra strict** | relaxed | skip |
| Copula avoidance | skip | strict | relaxed | strict | skip | skip |
| Uniform paragraph length | skip (short-form) | strict | strict | strict | relaxed | skip |

| Tier 3 phrase clustering | strict | strict | strict | **extra strict** | relaxed | skip |
| Future-narrative closers | strict | strict | strict | **extra strict** | skip | skip |
| Social endorsement closers | strict (the LinkedIn share-post tell) | strict | strict | strict | skip | relaxed (1 OK in a DM) |
| Hedge-stacked predictions | strict | strict | relaxed ("could" is hedged accuracy) | **extra strict** | relaxed | skip |
| Real/actual inflation | strict | strict | strict | **extra strict** | relaxed | skip |
| Moral-adjective category errors | strict | strict | relaxed | strict | relaxed | skip |
| Invented contrast-pair mirroring | strict | strict | relaxed | strict | relaxed | skip |
| Subjectless fragments and agentless passives | relaxed (short-form fragments are the register) | strict | relaxed | strict | skip (fragment lists are docs) | skip |

**Technical-blog word table exceptions:** These terms have legitimate technical meaning and should not be flagged in technical context: `robust`, `comprehensive`, `seamless`, `ecosystem`, `leverage` (when discussing actual platform leverage/APIs), `facilitate`, `underpin`, `streamline`. Still flag: `delve`, `tapestry`, `beacon`, `embark`, `testament to`, `game-changer`, `harness`.

**"Extra strict"** means: flag even borderline instances. In investor emails, a single "thriving ecosystem" can undermine the whole message.

**"Skip"** means: don't audit this category for this profile. The rule doesn't apply or isn't worth the edit.

### Auto-detection cues

When no context is specified, infer from these signals:

| Signal | Inferred context |
|--------|-----------------|
| Under 300 words + hashtags or mentions | `linkedin` |
| Code blocks, API references, or technical architecture | `technical-blog` |
| Salutation ("Hi [name]", "Dear") + investor/fundraising language | `investor-email` |
| Step-by-step instructions, parameter docs, README structure | `docs` |
| No strong signals | `blog` (safest default — all rules apply) |

If auto-detection feels wrong, say which profile you're using and why. The user can override.

## Voice profiles

Context profiles (above) set *how strict* to be for an audience. Voice profiles set *how the prose should sound* — the persona. They're independent axes: you can write blunt for a blog or warm for docs. Voice is **optional** — if the writer doesn't name one, infer it from the input's existing register and don't impose a persona on text that already has one.

Each profile is a set of concrete targets, not a vibe:

**`casual`** — Contractions throughout; their absence reads stiff. Short sentences (aim for ≤14 words on average); fragments allowed. At least one first-person or concrete-anecdote touch. Near-zero jargon. Keep warm hedges ("honestly," "I think") but cut corporate ones ("it's worth noting"). *Blog posts, social, community.*

**`professional`** — Active voice for most sentences. Vary sentence length; avoid three in a row within a few words of each other. One concrete claim per paragraph (a number, a name, a date), never "experts say." Make the ask explicit. Low tolerance for hedging. *LinkedIn, investor email, sponsor pitches.*

**`technical`** — Prefer plain copulatives ("X is Y") over inflated substitutes ("serves as," "stands as a testament to"). One idea per sentence; imperative mood for instructions. Jargon is fine, but define it on first use. Tables and lists only where the content is genuinely list-shaped, not for decoration. *Docs, technical blog.*

**`warm`** — Address the reader directly ("you") and acknowledge them at least once. Cut intensifiers ("very," "truly," "incredibly") in favor of stronger verbs. No performative-empathy openers ("I completely understand how you feel"). Medium sentences (15–20 words) for an unhurried cadence. *Mentorship, onboarding, thank-yous.*

**`blunt`** — Lead with the claim; cut "It's important to note that" windups. Em-dashes are rare here; use periods for emphasis. No padding to hit a rule of three. Near-zero hedging; flag "may / could / potentially" stacks. Short declaratives, with the occasional long sentence for contrast. *Decision memos, thought leadership, hard feedback.*

**Calibrate to a sample (optional).** If the writer gives you a sample of their own writing ("match my voice — here's a post"), analyze its sentence-length pattern, contraction rate, paragraph openings, and recurring word choices, then match those instead of a named profile. Don't "upgrade" their vocabulary: if they write "stuff" and "things," keep that register.

**How voice composes with context.** Voice sets the target; context sets how hard to enforce it. A voice *target* always applies, even where a context profile would skip that category — `technical` voice still prefers plain copulatives in a `casual` context that otherwise ignores copula avoidance. Where both axes govern the same rule and agree, they reinforce: `blunt` voice wants near-zero em-dashes and a `blog` context is already strict on them, so it stays a hard edit. Where they disagree, resolve toward the **stricter** of the two — a `warm` voice on `docs` still doesn't get decorative tables. Sensible default pairings: casual↔casual, professional↔linkedin/investor-email, technical↔docs/technical-blog.
